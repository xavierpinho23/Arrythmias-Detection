# Arrythmias Detection

In this project we used ECG analysis in order to detect Arrythmias: PVC (Premature Ventricular Contractions) and AF (Atrial Fibrillation).

1) ECG Signal:
-Detect R peaks (Pan Tompkins algorithm 1985);
-Estimation of average beats.

2) Arrythmias Detection:
-PVC detection;
-AF detection.
